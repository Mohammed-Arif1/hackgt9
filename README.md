Gesture Control Gamer Time

This is the shared repository for the Game gesture control. 

Current Idea:
  <p>Control Stardew Valley using hand gestures and movements using MediaPipe Python packages</p>
  <p>Below is an introduction to using MediaPipe with Python<br>
    https://google.github.io/mediapipe/getting_started/python </p>
  <p>Below is an intrduction to using the hand detection with MediaPipe <br>
    https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands#python-solution-api </p>
  <p><br> 
    We'll have to focus on different parts of the workflow???
    <br> Part1: We need to use media pipe to recognize gestures
    <br> Part2: We need to map those gestures to different inputs in stardew <br> https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Controls
    <br> Part3: We need to turn gestures into keyboard or controller interrupts so that Stardew can recognize those inputs. 
    <br> Options for this include modding Stardew or using an API to create keyboard interrupts </br>
